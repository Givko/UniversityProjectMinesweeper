	The goal of the game is to uncover all the squares that do not contain mines without being "blown up" by clicking on a square 
with a mine underneath. The location of the mines is discovered by a process of logic. Clicking on the game board will reveal 
what is hidden underneath the chosen square or squares (a large number of blank squares may be revealed in one go if they are 
adjacent to each other). Some squares are 0's but some contain numbers (1 to 8), each number being the number of mines adjacent to the 
uncovered square. 

	The game is won once all blank squares have been uncovered without hitting a mine.
